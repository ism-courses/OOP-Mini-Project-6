We have a Movie class defined in this repository.

The boss wants you to modify the following class to work with properties:
1. Define a getter for rating attribute using **@property decorator**
2. Define a setter for rating attribute using **@property decorator**
3. For the rating setter, design a if-else statement to check if a new rating is in the range between 1.0 and 5.0, if so set the rating, else print "Please enter a valid rating."
